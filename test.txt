-test 1:
allocated two equal blocks and a bigger one (success)

-test2:
allocated a too big block
allocation of the whole memory, so the allocation of another block fail

-test3:
allocated 5 blocks of 2nd level, so the last one fail

-test4:
requested 2nd level block and 1st level block (success)

-test5:
allocated a block of level 0, deallocated this one, allocated a smaller block
(so it test that when memory is deallocated it's available again)

-test6:
deallocation of a block two times

-test7:
when you allocate a block, you can't allocate an ancestor one but you can get a successor one 

-test8:
allocation of two 2nd level blocks, so the allocation of a 1st level block fail

-test9:
allocation of block 4,5,6, so the request for the 3rd block fail; when block 6 is released you can alloc block 3
